#Abstract : Diabetes prediction is a critical task for early intervention and management of the disease. This study focuses on the application of classification models for predicting diabetes. A comprehensive dataset comprising various clinical and demographic features related to diabetic patients is utilized. Preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the data, followed by the implementation of several classification algorithms for better understandings. Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results highlight the effectiveness of classification models in accurately predicting diabetes, facilitating timely intervention and personalized treatment plans. The findings of this study hold significant implications for healthcare professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions for diabetes prevention and management, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
#Data-set Information : The data-set consists of several predictor values and one target values. The target values is “diabetes” consists of 0 and 1. where 0 indicates no diabetes and 1 indicates patient has diabetes
EDA and Pre processing : Exploratory data analysis made on different variables in order to understand the data better.where we found that the blood glucose level, HbA1c value has more influence in the diabetic disorder than the other variable like smoking history, gender, bmi etc…
Model Building : The model building we use in this case study are 1. Decision Tree, 2. Random Forest, 3. Support Vector Machine, 4. Bagging method, 5. Hyperparameter tuning for Decision tree model.
Conclusion :After performing different types of models u sing the given data-set we can come into a conclusion th at the Decision tree model after hyper parameter tuning has the higher accuracy when compared with other mod el. So this model can help the medical industries to predi ct who has prone to the diabetic disorder.
